## Project Goal:

The goal for this analysis is to estimate the median house price for Condo in DC area. We perform Time-Series Linear Regression framework in our analysis. This analysis is statistical-based using two feature seletion methodolgies: stepwise regression and K-Best. In our next project, we will improve this model by applying more machine learning techniques.

## Summary of Data:

This analysis uses DC housing market data from Refin and macroeconomic data from Fred with the time periods between February 2012 and October 2019. Housing data includes data for prices (median sale price, percentage of homes sold above list price, percentage of homes that had price drop, etc.), inventory (number of homes on market, new listings, months of supply, etc.), and sales (number of homes sold, median days on market, etc.).
